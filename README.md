# ElectronJS Lightweight Text Editor

This project is a lightweight text editor built using ElectronJS. It is based on a [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEfbHcqbzMg) I followed to learn ElectronJS, and I plan to expand on it by adding more functionality with React and other concepts I learned from this project.
